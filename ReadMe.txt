This project is created to allow Arcemu users to spawn and despawn blizzlike calendar events.
In each folder in this project you will find 2 files. The names of the files are self-explanatory.
You use one of them to spawn the selected event and the other to despawn (remove) it.
In order to do this, you need to execute the sql files in your world database and then restart the server.

 Note that this project does not contain any kind of scripts (yet).
